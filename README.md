# 📊 Software Project Management

## 🎯 Overview
**Software Project Management** is a structured approach to planning, executing, and monitoring software projects. This repository includes essential project management tools such as **Gantt Charts, Activity on Arrow (AoA), Activity on Node (AoN), and Parallel Process Analysis** to ensure smooth project execution and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Features
📌 **Gantt Chart** – Visual representation of tasks, durations, and dependencies.  
📌 **Activity on Arrow (AoA)** – Depicts project activities with dependencies and milestones.  
📌 **Activity on Node (AoN)** – A node-based workflow visualization for efficient project tracking.  
📌 **Parallel Processes** – Identifying concurrent activities for optimized scheduling.  
📌 **Critical Path Method (CPM)** – Determine the longest sequence of dependent tasks to minimize project delays.  
📌 **Project Scheduling & Optimization** – Improve efficiency by analyzing task dependencies and workflow bottlenecks.
